## Extensions

I have a number of extensions installed to help me do my work. Most of these extensions are for syntax highlighting and code snippets, but some have other functionality. As a cloud engineer focused primarily on Azure, you'll notice an obvious trend in some of these extensions.

### Syntax Highlighting

- [Azure CLI Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli)
- [Azure Log Analytics (Kusto) Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josin.kusto-syntax-highlighting) - I don't know why MSFT doesn't have their own syntax highlighter for Kusto. If you find yourself writing a lot of Kusto queries, you can't go wrong with this one.
- [Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines)
- [Hashicorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform)
- [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) - Some our automation is done via PowerShell.

### Misc

- [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) - This handles authentication into Azure and lets you integrate a cloud shell right into VS Code.
- [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) - Sometimes I need to have multiple VS Code windows open at the same time. Peacock helps keep which window is which by adding a color bar to VS Code. Click the link to see an example.
- [WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) - I run the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) since my Windows laptop is pretty well locked-down. You'll want this extension to be able to integrate the terminal into WSL.

### Themes

- [Dank Neon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wuz.dank-neon) - This was my goto theme (dark, of course) for the longest time. I personally know one of the developers and just really like the color scheme.
- [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) - This is my current theme. I'm from the '80s and love the synthwave vibe from this theme. It's totally rad!

### FAQs

- I sometimes get asked why I don't have any Git-related extensions installed. The simple answer is because I don't do anything with Git via a GUI. I've not found any Git extensions that work for me. I just do it old-school on the CLI. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
